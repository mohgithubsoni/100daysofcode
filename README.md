# 🚀 100 Days of Code – Problem Solving with Java & Python

This repository documents my **100 Days of Code** challenge, where I consistently practice **data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving** using **Java** and **Python**.

The objective is straightforward:  
**improve logical thinking, strengthen problem-solving skills, and build strong DSA fundamentals through daily practice.**

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

This challenge is focused on **discipline and depth**, not surface-level learning.

Through this repository, I aim to:
- Strengthen **algorithmic thinking**
- Improve **coding efficiency and clarity**
- Develop a habit of **daily problem-solving**
- Prepare for **technical interviews and competitive programming**

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Java**
  - Primary language for implementing DSA concepts
  - Emphasis on clean code, OOP principles, and performance

- **Python**
  - Used for faster prototyping and logic-focused solutions
  - Helps in understanding algorithms with minimal syntax overhead

---


Each day may include:
- Problem statement or reference
- Java and/or Python solutions
- Optimized approaches and edge-case handling (when applicable)

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Searching & Sorting  
- Hashing  
- Linked Lists
